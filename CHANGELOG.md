## Unreleased

### utf8mb4 support

utf8(mb3) cannot store 4-byte characters (emoji), and unless `sql_mode` is strict
MySQL truncates the value at the first one **silently** — text is lost with no
error anywhere.

- **The shipped `sql/*.sql` dumps are now `utf8mb4` / `utf8mb4_general_ci`.**
  A charset is never named without its collation, so a table can no longer pick
  up the server default (`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` on MySQL 8) and collide with the
  rest of the schema on a join.
- **`Config::dbEncoding` / `dbCollation` still default to mb3.** Raising them
  would put an mb4 connection over the mb3 schema of every existing consumer on
  a mere `composer update`. New projects should set `utf8mb4` in their own
  `Data\Config`; existing ones convert first, then switch. See README.
- **New `diCore\Database\Tool\CharsetConverter`** — the conversion engine
  (per-column `MODIFY`, MyISAM→InnoDB, database default, stored programs,
  relaxed/strict session handling), so a consumer's migration is a few lines.
  It selects by **collation**, not charset, so a table already on utf8mb4 but
  carrying MySQL 8's default `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` is converted too — otherwise
  it keeps colliding with the rest of the schema on a join. Procedures,
  functions, views and triggers are rebuilt as well, and the DEFINER of every
  one of them is checked against the current account **before** the first
  `DROP`, since DDL does not roll back.
- **New migration `charset/20260728100000`** converts the tables this package
  ships to whatever charset the project configured. A no-op for a project that
  stays on mb3.
- **`diModel::getCreateTableQuery()` and `diActionsLog::initTable()`** follow the
  configured charset instead of a hardcoded `utf8`, via the new
  `Config::getDbCharsetClause()`.
- **`diDB::initCharset()` fixed:** `set_charset()` now runs BEFORE
  `SET NAMES … COLLATE …`. It issues its own `SET NAMES` and resets the collation
  to the charset default, so running it last silently discarded the configured
  collation — invisible on mb3 (same default), not on mb4. It also tolerates an
  empty collation and no longer swallows a failed `set_charset()`.
- **PDO driver:** the DSN charset comes from the configuration instead of a
  hardcoded `utf8`, which used to leave `PDO::quote()` on mb3 while the server
  session had moved to mb4.

Requires **MySQL 5.7.9+** (or an InnoDB `DYNAMIC` row format): the shipped
`slugs` and `localization` dumps index a `varchar(255)`, which needs 1020 bytes
in mb4 — over the 767-byte limit of the older `COMPACT` format.
